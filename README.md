# Custom Components and Props Practice

## Overview
This project is designed to help you practice building React components and passing props. You will create a simple app with two custom components that each accept at least 2 props.

## Instructions
1. Open up your  favorite code editor (e.g., VSCode), and clone this repository: `git clone URL`
2. From the VSCode command line, in the root directory of the cloned repository, call `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are ready to go.
3. Call `npm run dev` and then navigate to the displayed localhost URL to see what this project looks like so far.
4. Using `CustomButton.jsx` and `CustomButton.css` as inspiration, make 3 additional custom components (i.e. 3 additional `.jsx` files and 3 additional `.css` files). 
5. In each custom component, accept **at least 2 props** and use them to influence the components' behaviors in meaningfuls ways.
6. Import and call the 3 components inside `App.jsx`.
7. Ensure everything is working accordingly by re-running `npm run dev`.

## Submission

Submit a **quick** screen recording where you walk us through each custom component you made, showing the `.jsx` file and the `.css` file of each one as well as demonstrating what it looks like in `localhost`. I  

## Example Props Ideas:
- Text content and background color for a card.
- A name and age for a user profile component.
- URL prop that embeds a link.



Happy coding!
